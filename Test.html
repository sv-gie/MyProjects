    <p>  “It’s a historic decision and will make Jammu and Kashmir power surplus. I
          thank Prime Minister Modi for approving the much awaited 850 MW Ratle Hydroelectric Project at an
          investment of ₹5,282 crore and ensuring the unprecedented development of Jammu and Kashmir,” 
          Mr. Sinha said.
    </p>

    <p> He said Jammu and Kashmir was witnessing unprecedented growth and development in every sector. 
        “We are unlocking its potential to be self-reliant in the energy sector within a short span of 
        time,” he added.
